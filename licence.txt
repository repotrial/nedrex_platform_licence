Through a license agreement between Hamburg University (UH) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the NeDRex platform contains OMIM® Data. This license agreement enables us to sublicense OMIM® Data to End-User(s) of the NeDRex platform for the End-User(s)' internal research purposes. This sublicensing does not grant the End-User(s) any right to copy OMIM® Data for the purpose of providing the OMIM® data, and derivatives thereof, to any other party, or in any other way grant a sublicense or other similar rights to OMIM® Data or distribute NeDRexDB containing any part of the OMIM® Data. The rights granted to End-Users under the terms of this sublicense do not extend to affiliates of End-Users.

    1. UH AND END-USERS OF THE NEDREX PLATFORM AGREE THAT THE OMIM® DATA AND THE OMIM® DATABASE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AND THAT JHU MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OMIM® DATA OR THE OMIM® DATABASE INCLUDING ITS ACCURACY OR COMMERCIAL VIABILITY, USE IN RESEARCH, OR OTHER USES. JHU MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS THAT IT WILL PROVIDE UPDATES OR IN ANY WAY MAINTAIN OR SUPPORT THE OMIM® DATABASE.

    2. UH and end-users of the NeDRex platform shall defend and hold JHU, The Johns Hopkins Health Systems, their present and former trustees, officers, authors of the OMIM® Data and the OMIM® Database, agents, faculty, employees and students (“JHU Parties”) harmless as against any judgments, fees, expenses, or other costs arising from or incidental to any lawsuit, claim, demand or other action brought against JHU Parties as a consequence of the use or sublicensing of the OMIM® Data or OMIM® Database by UH, End-User(s), or other third parties that may otherwise gain access to the OMIM® Data or OMIM® Database through UH. Use of the OMIM Data and the OMIM Database by a third party on behalf of or for the account of UH or by an End-User(s), shall be considered UH’s use of the OMIM® Database for purposes of this Paragraph. The obligation of UH and end-users to defend and indemnify as set out in this Paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

    3. Term and Termination:

        3.1 The term of the sublicense Agreement shall be the same as the term of UH’s agreement with JHU, commencing on the date our license fee is received at Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures, and continuing for a period of three (3) years.

        3.2 UH may terminate this Agreement and the licence granted herein, for any reason, upon giving JHU sixty (60) days written notice.
        
        3.3 The agreement between UH and JHU (and, by extension, this sublicense agreement) may be terminated by JHU, in the event that UH breaches any material term of obligation hereunder including, but limited to, UH’s obligations with regard to licence fees and payments, reporting, and quality control, and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof. In no event, however, shall such notice of intention to terminate be deemed to waive any rights to damages or any other remedy that JHU may have as a consequence of such failure or breach by UH.
        
        3.4 Upon termination of the agreement between UH and JHU, UH will remove any Mirror Database from its server/computers and any part of OMIM® Data and/or any OMIM® Database from any of its non-profit proprietary derivative database(s) whether on its server/computers or not and from any other non-profit proprietary licensed product(s), and shall cease using OMIM® Data and the OMIM® Database, song with any applicable trademark(s), for any purpose.
        
        3.5 UH shall further terminate the sublicense agreements with End-User(s) with respect to OMIM® Data and the OMIM® Database and any applicable trademarks by providing notice of such to End-User(s) and by providing substitute non-profit proprietary databases or non-profit proprietary products, either of which do not contain any part of OMIM® Data and/or OMIM® Database. UH shall provide JHU with a notarized certification of compliance with this agreement within sixty (60) days of termination of this agreement.
        
        3.6 Termination of the agreement between UH and OMIM, for whatever reason, shall not affect the obligation of UH to make any payments for which it is liable prior to or upon such termination. Termination shall not affect JHU’s right to recover unpaid fees incurred prior to termination. Upon termination, all rights in and to the OMIM® Data and OMIM® Database and any applicable trademarks shall revert to JHU at no cost to JHU.

    4. Except as expressly stated herein, UH and End-Users of the NeDRex platform shall not use the name of The Johns Hopkins University or The Johns Hopkins Health System or any of its constituent parts, such as the Johns Hopkins Hospital or any contraction thereof or the name of the authors of the OMIM Data or OMIM Database in any advertising, promotional, sales literature or fundraising documents without prior written consent from an officer of JHU. UH and End-Users of NeDRex shall allow at least seven (7) business days notice of any proposed public disclosure for JHU's review and comment and/or to provide written consent.

    5. Prior to first commercial access to and/or distribution of any Mirror Database, Non-profit Proprietary Derivative Database(s) or Non-profit Proprietary Licensed Product(s) as the case may be in any particular country, UH shall establish and maintain, in each country in which Non-profit shall permit access to and/or distribution of any Mirror Database, Non-profit Proprietary Derivative Database(s) or Non-profit Proprietary Licensed Product(s), product liability or other appropriate insurance coverage appropriate to the risks involved in marketing any Mirror Database, Non-profit Proprietary Derivative Database(s) or Non-profit Proprietary Licensed Product(s) and will annually present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained. Upon JHU's request, Non-profit will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained. JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Non-profit's said insurance policies. If such Product Liability insurance is underwritten on a ‘claims made’ basis, Non-profit agrees that any change in underwriters during the term of this Agreement will require the purchase of ‘prior acts’ coverage to ensure that coverage will be continuous throughout the term of this Agreement.
